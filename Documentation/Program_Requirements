ArithmeTech Requirements:

Functional requirements:
1: Application must be able encode a message from the user using Arithmetic Coding.
    1.1: Can encode a file uploaded from the computer.
          1.1.1: The encoder must output a file that contains the encoded message.
          1.1.2: The encoded file must be a type that the decoder can read.
          1.1.3: the encoded message must end in a designated end-of-file character. {Specify character}
          1.1.4: The program must attach and EOF character to the header of the compressed file

    1.2: The user must specify which file type is being compressed.
          1.2.1: Encoded file must specify which type the file must be decoded into.
    1.3: The encoder must rescale the range to avoid integer underflow

2: Application must be able to decode an encoded file 
    2.1: Decoder must decode the file into the correct file type.
    2.2: Decoder must be able to recognize the end of file character to indicate the end of a message.

3: Application must contain a GUI with multiple pages.
    3.1: Must contains a home page with encoding and decoding. 
    3.2: Must contains a History Page which stores records containing {FileName, compressed file, date/time}

4: Application utilizes an adaptive model

5.0.0 program accesses a local database... (unfinished) THIS IS FOR CIS421


Non-Functional Requirements:
1: Average Compression Ratio must improve upon average huffman ratio.
2: The design must be structured to allow for new file types to be implemented easily.
