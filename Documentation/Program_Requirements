ArithmeTech Requirements:

Functional requirements:
1: Application must be able encode a message from the user using Arithmetic Coding.
    1.1: Can encode a file uploaded from the computer's files.
          1.1.1: The encoder must output a file that contains the encoded message.
          1.1.2: The encoded file must be a type that the decoder can read.
          1.1.3: the encoded message must end in a designated end of file character. {Specify character}
    1.2: The user must specify which file type is being compressed.
          1.2.1: Encoded file must specify which type the file must be decoded into.

2: Application must be able to decode an encoded file 
    2.1: Appliation must decode the file into the correct file type.

3: Supports a GUI with multiple pages.
    3.1: Contains a home page with encoding and decoding. 
    3.2: Contains a History Page
        3.2.1: Creates records containing {FileName, compressed file, date/time}
        3.2.2:

4.0.0 program accesses a local database... (unfinished) THIS IS FOR CIS421


Non-Functional Requirements:
1: Average Compression Ratio must improve upon average huffman ratio.
